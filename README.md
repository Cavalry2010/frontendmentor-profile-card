This challenge was very helpful to learn about background position and the ability of overlapping multiple backgrounds.

### Useful resources

- [MDN background-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me understand how to use background position on the webpage.
- [MDN Using multiple backgrounds](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Using_multiple_backgrounds) - This article on MDN is pretty good to learn how to add multiple backgrounds to the webpage.
